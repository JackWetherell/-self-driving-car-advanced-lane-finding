In this project, the goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video.

Relevent directories and files:
- camera_cal: Directory of all camera calibration images.
- examples: Directory containing some example data and code.
- output_images: Directory containing the results of the pipeline applied to the test images.
- test_images: Directory containing the test images to test the pipeline.
- advanced_lane_finding.ipynb: Notebook constaining all code and results.
- advanced_lane_finding.pdf: Print out of the notebook constaining all code and results
- project_video: Input video to annotate.
- project_video_output: Output annotated video. (FINAL RESULT)
- project_video_output_outliers: Output annotated video before outliers are removed.
- writeup.pdf: Write up of the method, results and discussion.
